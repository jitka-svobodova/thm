Evaluation of Search Results
============================
Things to consider:
- **Source:** Identify the author or organization publishing the information. Consider whether they are reputable and authoritative on the subject matter. Publishing a blog post does not make one an authority on the subject.
- **Evidence and reasoning:** Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments.
- **Objectivity and bias:** Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives. We are not interested in authors pushing shady agendas, whether to promote a product or attack a rival.
- **Corroboration and consistency:** Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check whether multiple reliable and reputable sources agree on the central claims.

Vulnerabilities and Exploits
=============================
CVE
----
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): a dictionary of vulnerabilities
- Provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and security issues in software and hardware products.
- Each vulnerability is assigned a CVE ID with a standardized format like CVE-2024-29988.
- https://www.cve.org/
- https://nvd.nist.gov/ (Example: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29988)

Exploit Database
-----------------
- We should not try to exploit a vulnerable system unless we are given permission, usually via a legally binding agreement. Now that we have permission to exploit a vulnerable system, we might need to find a working exploit code.
